[00:00:00] Look, on this channel, I talk SAS and
[00:00:02] tech entrepreneurship. But if you're a
[00:00:03] business owner of any kind, if you do
[00:00:05] not get what I put in this video, you're
[00:00:06] going to fail just like all these
[00:00:07] influencer businesses. So, I know what
[00:00:09] you're thinking. Why am I mentioning
[00:00:10] influencer businesses? Because it's a
[00:00:12] perfect example of what I need to teach
[00:00:14] you today. Your business is destined to
[00:00:15] fail without it. Check out this post on
[00:00:17] X the other day. You can see all the way
[00:00:19] from Logan Paul, Casey Neistat. I'm sure
[00:00:21] you've seen all the make money online
[00:00:23] influencers who've launched their own
[00:00:25] software companies and try to get into
[00:00:27] the AI agent business. All these
[00:00:29] businesses launch tons of hype, tons of
[00:00:32] customers, huge marketing, and then they
[00:00:34] all flop and fail. Why? It's because the
[00:00:37] procs failed to achieve product market
[00:00:40] fit. They didn't check to make sure they
[00:00:43] had this before they launched their
[00:00:44] business. And so, even with the best
[00:00:45] hype in the entire world, they still all
[00:00:47] failed. And product market fit is more
[00:00:49] than just making customers like your
[00:00:51] product. It's making sure people
[00:00:52] understand,
[00:00:54] stay, and continue to pay for your
[00:00:55] product, which is an entire other beast
[00:00:57] that we're going to tackle in this
[00:00:58] video. And if you can get this first,
[00:01:00] you can essentially guarantee your SAS
[00:01:02] product or any type of business you're
[00:01:04] running is going to work, keep
[00:01:05] customers, and keep growing and making
[00:01:08] you more money. People ask me all the
[00:01:09] time, "How do I know if my product idea
[00:01:11] is good?" This is the cheat code for it
[00:01:12] that I'm about to teach you. And I would
[00:01:14] listen because this built me a software
[00:01:15] company worth hundreds of millions of
[00:01:17] dollars, and I've used to build many,
[00:01:18] many smaller companies. They're worth
[00:01:19] eight figures. It's just crispy. This is
[00:01:21] how you do it and this is how you make
[00:01:23] sure it's going to work every single
[00:01:24] time and you don't have these businesses
[00:01:25] go
[00:01:27] like all these influencer businesses.
[00:01:29] Let's discuss. Here's the first thing.
[00:01:30] Product market fit. Woo spilled a
[00:01:33] mystical letters behind this. Everybody
[00:01:35] talks about product market fit. It's
[00:01:36] talked about in SAS. If you were in tech
[00:01:38] at all, this is everybody's product
[00:01:40] market fit. Product market fit. But no
[00:01:41] one knows what the [ __ ] product market
[00:01:43] fit is or has a definition for it. So,
[00:01:45] I'm going to give you a definition that
[00:01:46] actually works. And if you just achieve
[00:01:48] this one damn thing, you are going to
[00:01:51] have success. And in this video, I'm
[00:01:52] going to give you a checklist that you
[00:01:54] can go through to make sure you've
[00:01:55] achieved product market fit. Now, in a
[00:01:57] nutshell, what product market fit is is
[00:02:00] essentially where you've hit a point
[00:02:02] where your product has customers come
[00:02:04] in, people love the product, and you
[00:02:06] start seeing sales take off because
[00:02:07] people are buying your product, they're
[00:02:09] telling their friends about their
[00:02:10] product, they're using the product,
[00:02:11] they're buying more of your product, aka
[00:02:13] you have a product that works. But
[00:02:15] that's such a vague definition. And so
[00:02:17] what I actually think it is is when you
[00:02:20] actually have this and if you have this,
[00:02:22] you have a product that can scale and
[00:02:23] make you a lot of money if the market's
[00:02:25] big enough. It is when you have a
[00:02:27] collection of 20 to 50 customers that
[00:02:31] will actively freak the [ __ ] out if you
[00:02:34] turn off your product. And why would
[00:02:36] they freak out? It's because the result
[00:02:37] you are getting them is so consequential
[00:02:39] and so useful to their life that the
[00:02:41] amount of money they give you is not
[00:02:43] even an issue. It's trivial for them. In
[00:02:45] fact, they demand you take your money.
[00:02:46] If you started rejecting their money and
[00:02:48] block their access to the product, they
[00:02:50] would come with pitchforks, light your
[00:02:52] house on fire, be extremely upset. If
[00:02:54] you've ever noticed, for example, when
[00:02:56] Fortnite goes down for 15 minutes, the
[00:02:58] people don't complain or want refunds or
[00:03:00] want their money back or or to stop
[00:03:02] using the product, they start gouging
[00:03:04] their eyes out and screaming and losing
[00:03:05] their mind. This is what product market
[00:03:08] fit looks like. And so, whenever you're
[00:03:10] building a product, the first thing
[00:03:11] you're going to want to look for is
[00:03:12] this. But I'm going to break down
[00:03:14] specific criteria for you that if you
[00:03:15] achieve this checklist right here,
[00:03:18] you're going to have success because to
[00:03:19] get to this point right here, you need
[00:03:21] to know the indicators and what to build
[00:03:23] around and what things to build through.
[00:03:24] It's not just something that happens all
[00:03:26] at once. You have to build it in order.
[00:03:28] Okay, so look again, like I say before,
[00:03:30] this is exactly what I used to build my
[00:03:32] software company, Hyros, which is
[00:03:34] closing in on $40 million AR. We're
[00:03:36] growing about 40 50% a year right now.
[00:03:38] So it works obviously to this point. If
[00:03:40] you have a software company making $100
[00:03:41] million a year, please, you don't got to
[00:03:42] listen to this video, but at least works
[00:03:44] to this point. So, take it for what it
[00:03:45] is. Now, you're also going to see me
[00:03:46] doing the same exact process with our
[00:03:48] new AI product at Hyros. You're going to
[00:03:50] notice I'm not really marketing this
[00:03:51] product for the exact reason why these
[00:03:53] influencer businesses are blowing up.
[00:03:55] You're going to see me going through
[00:03:56] this exact same checklist. So, this
[00:03:57] [ __ ] works. So, pay attention. So,
[00:03:59] the first thing you need to look for is
[00:04:01] does it get a result for your target
[00:04:03] customer every single time? Okay. So
[00:04:08] let's talk about it in terms of my
[00:04:09] product air. So what we have right now
[00:04:12] is an AI agent. It goes out, you put on
[00:04:14] people's websites, it detects people
[00:04:15] coming to the website, and then it uses
[00:04:17] AI to reach out to them, bring them back
[00:04:18] to the website, close them, and get them
[00:04:20] on calls, increase sales. When it's put
[00:04:22] on a customer's website the right way,
[00:04:23] it increases their business by 3 to 5%
[00:04:26] each time. I'm not here to pitch you
[00:04:27] air. I'm just telling you what it does
[00:04:28] and how I look at my product and how you
[00:04:30] can look at it for your product. So the
[00:04:32] first thing is there's a lot of
[00:04:34] different types of businesses that could
[00:04:37] join up for this right now. For example,
[00:04:39] we could have like a an agency that's
[00:04:41] going to try and generate leads. Now the
[00:04:43] most important thing is we have to nail
[00:04:45] our target market first off. And so
[00:04:47] where we're trying to really get the
[00:04:49] best results are are for SAS and Shopify
[00:04:52] stores. Okay, this is our target
[00:04:54] customer with this initially. Works for
[00:04:56] everything, but these are the ones we
[00:04:58] really want to get results with every
[00:04:59] single time. So, the most important
[00:05:02] thing you need to do is you need to
[00:05:03] identify your target customer. It can't
[00:05:05] be everybody. We don't need to get
[00:05:07] results for everybody. Not everybody
[00:05:09] that logs in has every type of business
[00:05:10] type, whether they're running a zoo or a
[00:05:12] [ __ ] Pokemon card store, needs to be
[00:05:14] able to sign up and get results. Just
[00:05:15] your target market, whatever it is, pick
[00:05:18] a target market, go after it. If they
[00:05:19] sign up and you hold their hand and do
[00:05:21] it for them, do they get a result 100%
[00:05:24] of the time? If the answer is no, your
[00:05:26] product isn't good enough. You don't
[00:05:28] need to be marketing it. You don't need
[00:05:29] to be taking the market. You don't need
[00:05:30] to be trying to sell it. This is it. The
[00:05:32] end. You need to go back and say, "Hey,
[00:05:35] have we nailed our target customer and
[00:05:37] their problems well enough to get them
[00:05:39] results or not. If it's not like if
[00:05:41] they're not coming in and getting a
[00:05:42] result every single time, the product
[00:05:44] doesn't work. Now, they don't have to
[00:05:45] come up and set up the product. They
[00:05:47] don't even have to use the product. If
[00:05:48] you use the product for them, aka you
[00:05:50] jerryrig it for success for them. You
[00:05:52] use your own product on their store,
[00:05:54] will they get results?" The answer is
[00:05:55] no. Do not move past this step. Keep
[00:05:57] doing this until this step is at 100%.
[00:06:00] You don't have to get them to sign up
[00:06:02] for the software or your product or
[00:06:03] whatever you're using again and they get
[00:06:05] the result. If you did it for them,
[00:06:07] would they 100% get a result? Because
[00:06:09] getting them to use the product and
[00:06:10] actively use it in their lives is a
[00:06:12] whole entire other problem. But this is
[00:06:13] the first one. Does it get a result 100%
[00:06:15] of the time? So at Air for example,
[00:06:17] before we even took this live or
[00:06:19] mentioned it, we made sure we got about
[00:06:20] 20 Shopify stores. We put them on. We
[00:06:23] made sure their revenue increased 3 to
[00:06:24] 5% when we put it on. We got SAS
[00:06:26] companies. We made sure their calls
[00:06:27] increase every single time when we set
[00:06:29] it up for them. We didn't market it. We
[00:06:31] didn't go and make some big drop. We
[00:06:32] made sure it worked every damn time
[00:06:35] before even considering putting this on
[00:06:36] our website. Now, let's look at these
[00:06:39] influencer businesses that are launching
[00:06:41] all the time. I'm going to give you just
[00:06:42] two really super duper simple examples.
[00:06:44] You see a lot of business gurus go and
[00:06:46] launch softwares. And if you've seen
[00:06:49] them launch them, the softwares are
[00:06:51] always gone within a year. Why does this
[00:06:52] happen? If they have such a huge
[00:06:54] following, and they have so many people
[00:06:55] that know about them, it's because their
[00:06:57] customers all come in, they don't get
[00:06:59] results, and then they stop paying for
[00:07:00] the software. If you do not have
[00:07:02] customers that pay three times, four
[00:07:04] times, six times, and pay for the next
[00:07:06] two, three, four years and keep coming
[00:07:07] back to your business, you don't have a
[00:07:08] business. You just don't have a
[00:07:10] business. So, there's no point in
[00:07:11] launching a product if people are not
[00:07:13] getting the result that they're looking
[00:07:14] for. You see all these fitness people
[00:07:16] launch these results in these courses or
[00:07:18] supplements and then people don't get
[00:07:20] results and people just don't give you
[00:07:21] money for [ __ ] they don't need. If they
[00:07:23] don't need something they are cutting it
[00:07:25] off like that. You must make sure they
[00:07:27] get a result 100% of the time. Now the
[00:07:29] next thing you need to do once they are
[00:07:31] getting result 100% of the time you
[00:07:32] actually are cooking with fire because
[00:07:33] your main challenge right now is not
[00:07:35] having a product to get results. It's
[00:07:36] getting people to actually use the
[00:07:37] product and get results. So you must
[00:07:39] move to the next step which is the big
[00:07:41] question. Is this target market big
[00:07:43] enough? Okay. So, for example, if we got
[00:07:46] 1% of the entire SAS market and 1% of
[00:07:48] the entire Shopify market with Hyros
[00:07:51] Air, well, we we're making hundreds of
[00:07:53] millions of dollars a year. Perfectly
[00:07:54] fine. Market's big enough. If we are
[00:07:56] going after every single organic dentist
[00:08:01] in the Plano area, that's our that's our
[00:08:03] target demographic or the little suburb.
[00:08:06] No, we're not going to be able to scale
[00:08:07] this to $100 million a year. You need to
[00:08:09] be able to look at what's your goal
[00:08:11] income. So, if you want to make a
[00:08:13] million dollar per year, you can
[00:08:14] actually just go in a small market and
[00:08:16] make a small business that makes a
[00:08:17] million per year and just dominate the
[00:08:19] hell out of it. Totally fine. If you
[00:08:21] want to go and make $10 million, you're
[00:08:22] going to need more target customers. You
[00:08:23] need to look at the type of customers
[00:08:25] you're working with as well. For
[00:08:27] example, Harvey is a AI agent platform
[00:08:31] for lawyers and it only has about 500
[00:08:35] customers. I think last I checked
[00:08:36] they're doing about $150 million a year
[00:08:38] in revenue or something crazy like that.
[00:08:40] I I forgot it was, but they had a very
[00:08:42] small amount of customers in return for
[00:08:44] how much money they're making. So again,
[00:08:46] because their target market is lawyers,
[00:08:47] there doesn't need to be zillions of
[00:08:48] customers. There just needs to be like a
[00:08:50] thousand of them, 500 of them, and
[00:08:51] they're doing very, very well. I looked
[00:08:53] at another company called Turig, and
[00:08:56] most of their money all comes from eight
[00:08:58] customers. If you look at Nvidia, I
[00:09:00] think almost all of their revenue comes
[00:09:01] from like two or three other companies.
[00:09:04] So, you got to think, you got to look at
[00:09:06] these numbers and you got to actually
[00:09:07] look at the customer size and what's
[00:09:09] going on there. So after you've
[00:09:11] identified that the target is market is
[00:09:12] big enough, you now need to go and
[00:09:15] determine if the problem and solution is
[00:09:17] big enough. Okay, so what do I mean by
[00:09:20] this? Remember when I said those people
[00:09:21] who get angry if you turn it off? So
[00:09:23] look, if you come and create some type
[00:09:24] of glue that makes my refrigerator stop
[00:09:26] squeaking and the glue costs $1,000,
[00:09:29] I'm probably just not going to pay you
[00:09:31] for that because that's not that big of
[00:09:32] a problem in my life. However, if I have
[00:09:35] a wart growing on my face and without
[00:09:39] your ointment, this wart just gets
[00:09:41] bigger and bigger, I will pay you
[00:09:42] $10,000 a day for that product. So, what
[00:09:46] you need to understand about this is
[00:09:47] that you need to solve a problem that's
[00:09:48] big enough in relation to the money that
[00:09:50] you're trying to charge that the person
[00:09:52] will lose their absolute mind if you
[00:09:54] turn it off. For example, if we connect
[00:09:57] someone to air at Hyros and they're
[00:09:59] making an extra 3 to 5% a month. Say
[00:10:01] it's a Shopify store making 100,000 a
[00:10:03] month and then we make them an extra
[00:10:05] $5,000 $7,000 per month and then we turn
[00:10:08] off air. They get really peevey very
[00:10:10] quickly. Like we can flip it on and off
[00:10:11] and make their emotions go up. We don't
[00:10:13] do this. Okay, this not this is not
[00:10:15] something we've attempted at Hyros. But
[00:10:17] I'm making the point right here. If you
[00:10:19] look at, for example, Logan Paul's Prime
[00:10:21] energy drink, which is not doing so well
[00:10:23] right now from what I heard. I'm
[00:10:24] actually I like Logan Paul. There's
[00:10:26] nothing against Logan Paul or anything
[00:10:26] they're doing. It's just the prime
[00:10:28] example of an influencer business not
[00:10:29] going well after taking off. Did the
[00:10:31] people get morbidly upset when they took
[00:10:32] away Prime or they stopped buying Prime?
[00:10:34] No. They didn't have a hard problem that
[00:10:36] they solved. That's it. It didn't.
[00:10:38] People didn't get super upset when you
[00:10:39] when they stopped buying Prime. Problem
[00:10:42] right there. If you look at a lot of
[00:10:43] these influencer businesses where they
[00:10:45] launch software, they make an attempt at
[00:10:46] software. What happens when people
[00:10:48] forget to pay their bill at the software
[00:10:50] companies that these influencers launch?
[00:10:52] Nothing. like the people don't notice.
[00:10:54] They're like, "Oh, this software I was
[00:10:55] paying for, uh, it's not there anymore."
[00:10:58] If you have that situation, you don't
[00:11:00] have a you don't have a company. Yeah,
[00:11:02] you can solve the problem, but if the
[00:11:03] problem's not that big, the person is
[00:11:04] not going to stick around. You want
[00:11:06] something, the second that credit card
[00:11:08] bill defaults or something, the person
[00:11:11] flips out because it's turn off. If if I
[00:11:13] don't pay my cell phone bill, it turns
[00:11:15] off. I notice like immediately within
[00:11:17] minutes. Okay. If I don't pay our Amazon
[00:11:20] AWS bill at Hyros, our entire software
[00:11:23] goes offline. We notice pretty quickly.
[00:11:25] Now, you don't need to have a problem
[00:11:26] that big, but this is what you need to
[00:11:28] do. If you have your product online,
[00:11:29] whether it's a supplement, whatever,
[00:11:31] just go turn it off for 30 minutes. If
[00:11:33] you don't have multiple customer support
[00:11:35] tickets with people getting really mad,
[00:11:36] you don't really have a product. Okay?
[00:11:38] Uh if if you want to if you have a
[00:11:40] supplement or something like that, just
[00:11:42] go to your site and turn off the order
[00:11:44] form for a day. If you don't have people
[00:11:46] pounding down the door and saying, "What
[00:11:47] the hell was going on?" and saying book
[00:11:48] me or notify me as soon as it comes back
[00:11:50] online. You don't have a product. Okay?
[00:11:53] You have to do this step right here
[00:11:54] after those steps I just talked about.
[00:11:56] Now, at this point, if you have these
[00:11:58] things I just talked about, you're
[00:11:59] cooking with grease. You got something
[00:12:01] good. Your biggest challenge right now
[00:12:02] is getting the [ __ ] the person,
[00:12:04] if this is the person and this is the
[00:12:06] cookie you're selling them, it's to put
[00:12:08] that damn cookie in their mouth. Because
[00:12:10] you have to understand, you need to love
[00:12:11] your customer. Your customer is the
[00:12:13] number one most important thing. You
[00:12:14] need to be obsessed with these people
[00:12:16] and you need to love them because what
[00:12:18] they're doing is they're paying for you
[00:12:19] and your staff's entire life. And if
[00:12:21] your company is successful, making all
[00:12:23] of you very rich. Like they're the best
[00:12:24] thing ever. Okay? But you also have to
[00:12:27] look at them this way. And this is a
[00:12:28] really good thought experiment. Don't
[00:12:29] think of your customers like this, but
[00:12:31] look at them and think in this way.
[00:12:33] Imagine your customers are a 5-year-old
[00:12:35] who's super grumpy, past their bedtime,
[00:12:37] will put effort into and nothing.
[00:12:39] They're just a little fat little
[00:12:40] fiveyear-old and will not lift a finger
[00:12:42] to get any result with your product.
[00:12:44] They will not read. They will not read
[00:12:46] more than five words at a time. They
[00:12:48] will look off in different directions.
[00:12:49] Their phone will be going off. Just
[00:12:50] think of them as the most ADHD psycho
[00:12:53] three-year-old past their bedtime grumpy
[00:12:54] person who hates you. And then imagine
[00:12:56] you're trying to get them to use your
[00:12:57] product. This is the key because for
[00:13:00] example, let's talk about Dropbox. I'm
[00:13:02] sure you've heard of them. So when they
[00:13:04] launched their product, this is
[00:13:06] something that had all the criteria that
[00:13:07] I talked to you about in the previous
[00:13:10] sections. All those all those things in
[00:13:12] the list, they had it. But when people
[00:13:13] came and signed up for them and they
[00:13:15] presented the promo to people and they
[00:13:17] had people try to sign up, only about
[00:13:19] 10% of people got to the point where
[00:13:20] they actually use the software. I don't
[00:13:22] care if you send a million people into
[00:13:24] the business. I don't care if you have
[00:13:25] Mr. Beast take his shirt off, light his
[00:13:27] nipples on fire, and declare it the best
[00:13:29] software or product on earth in the
[00:13:30] history of products. You don't have a
[00:13:33] business. It doesn't matter. So, what
[00:13:34] you need to do as soon as you have this,
[00:13:36] you need to go into your product
[00:13:38] experience, whether it's a supplement,
[00:13:39] whether it's a tool people have at their
[00:13:41] house, whether it's a software, and say,
[00:13:43] what is the initial experience like? And
[00:13:45] one, is it memorable? Is it impressive?
[00:13:47] Does it leave a good vibe with the
[00:13:48] customer in the first two minutes? Okay,
[00:13:51] in the first two minutes. And more
[00:13:53] importantly, does the customer get some
[00:13:55] sort of value and recognize the value in
[00:13:58] the first two minutes? Because if people
[00:13:59] don't recognize value, they're going to
[00:14:01] bounce. and does the customer understand
[00:14:03] the value and how to get it easily
[00:14:05] within the first two minutes. If they
[00:14:07] don't, it's not going to work. So, what
[00:14:09] you're going to see is a really good way
[00:14:10] to personify this is if you look at most
[00:14:12] SAS companies setups, um the time it
[00:14:16] takes to get value is weeks. And when
[00:14:18] people sign into software companies a
[00:14:19] lot of times, think about software tools
[00:14:21] you've bought for your business. It's
[00:14:22] like they showed up to an empty
[00:14:24] warehouse with a bunch of IKEA furniture
[00:14:26] everywhere and it says good luck in the
[00:14:27] middle. No one's going to stay around
[00:14:29] and use that even if it if it removes
[00:14:31] the wart on their face kind of problem.
[00:14:33] So what you want to do is make sure that
[00:14:35] the person gets to that initial value
[00:14:37] and has that aha moment in the first two
[00:14:39] minutes and they don't have to think. So
[00:14:41] two really good examples of this type of
[00:14:44] care is go sign up for a software called
[00:14:46] Gamma. It's a AI generation PowerPoint
[00:14:49] company worth billions of dollars right
[00:14:50] now and they've been able to achieve
[00:14:51] that in like two in the last two years.
[00:14:53] Crazy growth. The reason why they've
[00:14:54] been able to do this is they spent so
[00:14:56] much time on their first their original
[00:14:57] 30 seconds to two minutes. And if you go
[00:14:59] sign up for that software, you're going
[00:15:00] to be creating AI powerpoints and seeing
[00:15:02] the benefits and value of the software
[00:15:04] within seconds and you won't have to
[00:15:05] think. It has like coloring book
[00:15:07] pictures to get there. So the same thing
[00:15:09] when we were launching Hyros Air
[00:15:11] originally for our Shopify customers
[00:15:13] originally from the sign up they had to
[00:15:15] go through the hyro setup. They had to
[00:15:16] install some code. They had to do all
[00:15:17] this stuff. We reduced the entire setup.
[00:15:19] I'll put it on the screen right now from
[00:15:21] this which is just a bunch of jargon and
[00:15:23] onboarding stuff to literally this thing
[00:15:25] I'm playing on the screen right now. It
[00:15:27] takes the setup down to about 15 seconds
[00:15:30] and immediately within those 15 seconds
[00:15:32] they don't have to put a card down. They
[00:15:33] start seeing the software working and
[00:15:35] generating customers on their site that
[00:15:36] day. Okay. And so why did we do that and
[00:15:40] why did we not even launch the product
[00:15:42] until we had something like that up or
[00:15:44] start mass marketing which we haven't
[00:15:45] done yet. this same exact concept right
[00:15:48] here. Same thing as Dropbox. Same same
[00:15:50] thing as Gamma. I don't care what you're
[00:15:52] selling. Imagine if Eat Sleep, for
[00:15:54] example. You know that mattress that
[00:15:55] everybody sleeps on right now. That
[00:15:56] mattress, imagine if it show up to
[00:15:58] people's house and like there wasn't any
[00:15:59] good instructions and the manual stunk
[00:16:01] and stuff like that and you just got a
[00:16:02] big old mattress in a box. I don't care
[00:16:03] if that thing gets down to sub-zero
[00:16:05] arctic temperatures and makes you lose
[00:16:07] weight while you're sleeping. No one's
[00:16:08] going to put it on. And so that's why
[00:16:10] they made the boxes, the setup, the the
[00:16:12] phone app, everything. impressive as
[00:16:14] hell, clean as hell, and just like
[00:16:16] literally coloring book. If you ever sat
[00:16:18] up one of those beds, it's like put cord
[00:16:20] in thing. They have like pictures, big
[00:16:21] giant pictures. They don't even use
[00:16:22] words because everyone's too [ __ ]
[00:16:24] stupid to read these days. They have
[00:16:25] that. Okay, so what you need to do is
[00:16:28] you start getting your first customers
[00:16:29] in and you measure how often a customer
[00:16:31] comes in and gets results. You don't
[00:16:32] need to be marketing this [ __ ]
[00:16:34] until they get 100% of the way there. I
[00:16:36] guarantee all these influencer software
[00:16:37] businesses you see that always launch,
[00:16:39] they probably have one, they always
[00:16:41] charge people upfront because they know
[00:16:42] the people aren't going to get the
[00:16:43] result. It's not because they're trying
[00:16:44] to scam. It's just because they're
[00:16:45] stupid. They're like they don't they
[00:16:48] don't understand how to build a
[00:16:49] long-term business. And so they think
[00:16:50] they just need to charge up front
[00:16:51] because they're not going to get their
[00:16:52] money any other way. And so what they're
[00:16:55] going to do is they have all the people
[00:16:56] come in. Someone pays $1,000 for their
[00:16:57] [ __ ] software. And then 5% of the
[00:17:00] people even get to fully set up with the
[00:17:02] software because that's how software
[00:17:03] works. You don't have a business. The
[00:17:04] next time this bill rolls around and
[00:17:06] people aren't going to resubscribe,
[00:17:07] business is dead after the second
[00:17:08] reoccurring bill. That's it. Why on
[00:17:11] [ __ ] name would you send 100,000
[00:17:13] people down this funnel when 95% of them
[00:17:15] are going to cancel just cuz they can't
[00:17:16] even get to the value of your software?
[00:17:18] I don't care if your software literally
[00:17:19] makes your dick 10 feet bigger. It's not
[00:17:21] going to work if they don't get to the
[00:17:23] value. So once you get people going down
[00:17:25] your funnels and after they buy or do
[00:17:27] your trial and you get to 90% of people
[00:17:29] getting to the value and understanding
[00:17:31] the value and getting what you're doing,
[00:17:33] what you then need to do is look at this
[00:17:35] one last final thing. Is it good enough
[00:17:37] that they're telling their friends, this
[00:17:39] is their friend, this is friends about
[00:17:41] it. This is the final step. If you have
[00:17:44] all those things I said before, people
[00:17:46] getting morbidly upset when you turn it
[00:17:48] off. 90% of people getting to the result
[00:17:50] and you can witness them telling their
[00:17:52] friends about you can put things in
[00:17:53] there like an affiliate program or
[00:17:54] distribution model uh kind of like for
[00:17:57] example Zapier all the software
[00:17:58] companies that plugged into it they made
[00:18:01] pages on their website and all the
[00:18:02] companies started sending people to
[00:18:03] their uh to the Zapier website to hook
[00:18:06] in with Zapier distribution model right
[00:18:08] there. If you look at school for
[00:18:09] example, people really like school and
[00:18:11] so they go and create classrooms on
[00:18:12] school and they share the [ __ ] of it
[00:18:13] because they get affiliate incomes from
[00:18:15] school uh or from the school classrooms
[00:18:17] doing it and they also really like the
[00:18:19] product. The same exact thing going on
[00:18:20] with [ __ ] in that situation right now.
[00:18:22] That's why WOP's growing like crazy
[00:18:24] because people share it and tell all
[00:18:25] their friends about it. They create this
[00:18:26] community where people are talking about
[00:18:28] two prime examples right there in
[00:18:30] software right now. I really want you to
[00:18:32] think about the experiences you've had
[00:18:33] with products and what products you're
[00:18:34] really into. You probably have a few
[00:18:36] supplements. You probably have a few
[00:18:37] clothing brands. some things you just
[00:18:39] really like and you've told a lot of
[00:18:40] people about without any incentive from
[00:18:43] the company. You probably most of the
[00:18:44] things you use, that's how you use them
[00:18:46] or you look for some referral online.
[00:18:48] Once you have that, that's when things
[00:18:50] are crispy. That's when things are
[00:18:51] really crispy because what you're going
[00:18:52] to have is you have this funnel where
[00:18:54] people freak out. They want to keep
[00:18:55] paying you. They come in at such a high
[00:18:57] rate and have success at high rate that
[00:18:58] they keep paying you to super high rate
[00:18:59] and then they tell their friends and
[00:19:00] your their friends all go through that
[00:19:02] same exact process. This is how
[00:19:03] companies like Slack or Gamma or other
[00:19:05] companies I mentioned in this video go
[00:19:07] from nothing to worth billions of
[00:19:09] dollars hyper quickly. This is all there
[00:19:11] is to it. And then once you have all
[00:19:13] this, you have like this this steroid
[00:19:17] chipmunk covered in gasoline. All right.
[00:19:19] This is He's right here. Here's his
[00:19:21] ears. And you also It's also shaped like
[00:19:25] Wyoming. We'll give him a give him a
[00:19:30] There you go. There's
[00:19:32] There it is. You have the superpowered
[00:19:34] squirrel covered in gasoline and you're
[00:19:36] just sitting in him with a flamethrower
[00:19:37] at this point. Okay, this is a terrible
[00:19:39] example.
[00:19:45] Anyways, you got this [ __ ] squirrel
[00:19:47] and you have this thing that would have
[00:19:48] just been a little bundle of matches.
[00:19:50] It's now a giant log covered in gasoline
[00:19:52] and it just explodes when you send stuff
[00:19:54] in there and then people stay for years
[00:19:56] and so you keep this energy. What is
[00:19:59] going on with all these influencer
[00:20:00] businesses and how most people run their
[00:20:01] businesses is they don't have that and
[00:20:03] so they have this pile of matches. They
[00:20:04] send in thousands of people into the
[00:20:06] pile of matches. There's a little puff
[00:20:07] and then the energy gets lost. It it
[00:20:10] doesn't escape. You want to start off
[00:20:12] with five people. Just five five
[00:20:14] [ __ ] come in there. You send
[00:20:16] them in and you make sure all five of
[00:20:17] those [ __ ] stay. They do not
[00:20:19] want to leave. They they will fight you
[00:20:20] if you're like, "Hey, it's time to
[00:20:21] leave." They're like, "That's what you
[00:20:23] want." Okay. Then once you have that,
[00:20:25] you make sure all those other things
[00:20:26] like establish, you make sure when you
[00:20:27] send five more [ __ ] in there,
[00:20:29] they get all the way there and they end
[00:20:30] up in that same psychotic place as those
[00:20:31] other five [ __ ] And then you
[00:20:33] make sure they tell five other
[00:20:34] [ __ ] about it. Then once you
[00:20:35] have all these [ __ ] right here
[00:20:36] staying in here getting all humpy
[00:20:37] dumpty, then you send in a thousand
[00:20:39] [ __ ] into this environment
[00:20:41] right here and none of them leave. So
[00:20:42] this is the exit. They're all like,
[00:20:44] "Nope, nope." They bar the exit and make
[00:20:46] it so you can't even put the exit there
[00:20:48] without them suing you or something.
[00:20:49] That's when you are going to have an
[00:20:52] incredibly wildly successful business.
[00:20:53] And if any of these influencers did it,
[00:20:55] the reason their businesses are failing
[00:20:56] is not because they're influencers or
[00:20:58] hype doesn't matter. Hype reallying
[00:21:00] matters. It's it's it's phenomenal. It's
[00:21:02] it's it's great. You want to have lots
[00:21:03] of hype. It's great marketing. It
[00:21:05] matters that you have these things so
[00:21:06] the customers stay after they hit. It's
[00:21:08] the only thing. If Logan Paul had done
[00:21:09] this with his and they they had found
[00:21:11] some way to make Prime stick and they
[00:21:13] had done test groups where people
[00:21:14] actually kept buying it. They made sure
[00:21:16] people kept buying it without prompting
[00:21:18] from Logan and KSI every single time. A
[00:21:20] zillion dollar brand. If all the other
[00:21:22] companies that I mentioned made sure
[00:21:23] that people kept buying, if all these
[00:21:25] influencers and make money influencers,
[00:21:26] the softwares they launched, uh the
[00:21:28] crypto companies they launched and all
[00:21:30] stuff, they made sure people kept buying
[00:21:32] afterwards, zillion dollar companies,
[00:21:34] zillion dollar companies immediately,
[00:21:36] but they don't. And so they become zero
[00:21:38] dollar companies. They go that's why you
[00:21:40] see companies like school. I don't know
[00:21:41] if you know Sam Ovens, he used to be an
[00:21:43] influencer, used to be a make money guy.
[00:21:44] He's like, "Hey, you know what? I'm just
[00:21:45] going to go sit in my house and never
[00:21:46] [ __ ] talk to anybody ever again." He
[00:21:49] made school. He did this exact same
[00:21:50] process. Make sure that every person
[00:21:52] that comes in stays forever and then he
[00:21:54] slowly just got more [ __ ] in
[00:21:56] who told everybody about everything else
[00:21:57] and then it just slowly fly out. You
[00:21:59] will never see Sam on the internet like
[00:22:00] at all anymore. There's like videos on
[00:22:02] like with 30,000 views and the company's
[00:22:03] worth like $800 million. So you tell me
[00:22:05] what works. It's this process right
[00:22:08] here. It's simply this process right
[00:22:10] here. This is the same process I use to
[00:22:11] get high roast my business a large
[00:22:13] amount. This is the exact same process
[00:22:14] I'm using at our new product there as
[00:22:16] well. I think if you look need tracking
[00:22:18] for your SAS or Shopify company or you
[00:22:20] want literally to just add three to five
[00:22:22] percent more calls or revenue, you
[00:22:23] should check out Hyros Air or Hyros
[00:22:25] tracking. It [ __ ] hard. You you'll like
[00:22:28] it a lot. But this video isn't the pitch
[00:22:30] of those things to tell you how to build
[00:22:31] your bu your business properly and
[00:22:33] what's worked for me over and over and
[00:22:35] over again. So that's the video. If you
[00:22:37] like these videos, subscribe and um you
[00:22:39] know, bye.
